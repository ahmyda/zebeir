  {
    q: "Applied Linguistics primarily focuses on:",
    choices: ["Abstract language universals", "Real-world problems where language is central"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " As Brumfit (1977) said, AL investigates 'real-world problems in which language is a central issue.'"
  },
  {
    q: "Theoretical linguistics differs from Applied Linguistics because it:",
    choices: ["Studies idealized, rule-governed systems", "Solves classroom miscommunication"],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: " Theoretical linguistics examines abstract structures; AL tackles messy, contextual issues like teaching or policy."
  },
  {
    q: "‘Linguistics Applied’ assumes that:",
    choices: ["Language problems require social context", "Linguistic rules can be directly applied to solve problems"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " ‘Linguistics Applied’ ignores context; AL mediates theory through cultural and psychological lenses."
  },
  {
    q: "Which field would analyze how Algerian political speeches construct national identity?",
    choices: ["Phonology", "Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA)"],
    answer: 1,

    choices: ["Describe universal syntax", "Resolve real-world language-based problems"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Spot on! Spolsky emphasized solving problems faced by learners, teachers, lawyers, and policymakers."
  },
  {
    q: "Which area of AL helps diagnose developmental dyslexia?",
    choices: ["Theoretical semantics", "Clinical linguistics"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " Clinical linguistics applies linguistic knowledge to speech and communication disorders."
  },
  {
    q: "Language testing in AL ensures exams are:",
    choices: ["Based only on grammar", "Fair, valid, and culturally unbiased"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " AL ensures tests reflect real communication—not just grammatical accuracy."
  },
  {
    q: "How has AL evolved since the 1960s?",
    choices: ["It now focuses only on grammar teaching", "It expanded to include forensic linguistics, CDA, policy, and more"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " AL grew from language teaching to a broad, socially engaged field."
  },
  {
    q: "Why can’t theoretical linguistics alone solve a biased test failure?",
    choices: ["It ignores identity, power, and access", "It uses too much math"],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Precisely! Real issues involve context—something theoretical linguistics deliberately excludes."
  },
  {
    q: "Contrastive Analysis (CA) is based on which learning theory?",
    choices: ["Cognitive constructivism", "Behaviorism"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " CA treats language learning as habit formation influenced by L1 habits."

  {
    q: "According to Lado (1957), CA predicts difficulty by:",
    choices: ["Comparing L1 and L2 structures", "Analyzing student essays"],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: " Lado said we can predict learning problems by systematically comparing native and target languages."
  },
  {
    q: "What does ‘negative transfer’ mean in CA?",
    choices: ["L1 and L2 are similar, easing learning", "L1 and L2 differ, causing interference"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " Negative transfer occurs when L1 structures interfere with L2 learning."
  },
  {
    q: "An Arab learner saying ‘he come’ instead of ‘he comes’ is likely due to:",
    choices: ["Overgeneralization", "L1 interference (negative transfer)"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " Arabic lacks third-person -s, so this is classic L1 transfer."
  },
  {
    q: "In Stockwell’s CA hierarchy, which is the MOST difficult level?",
    choices: ["Complete correspondence", "Split (L1 has one form, L2 has two)"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " A ‘split’ (e.g., Arabic /b/ vs. English /p, b/) is the hardest to learn."
  },
  {
    q: "Which CA level applies when Arabic has grammatical gender but English doesn’t?",
    choices: ["Absent category", "New category"],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: " ‘Absent category’ means L1 has a feature missing in L2."
  },
  {
    q: "A key assumption of Lee (1968) was that:",
    choices: ["L1 interference is the main cause of L2 difficulty", "Errors come only from overgeneralization"],

    choices: ["Multilingual classrooms", "Homogeneous L1 groups (e.g., all Arab learners)"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " CA works best when all students share the same L1."
  },
  {
    q: "A major criticism of CA is that it:",
    choices: ["Overpredicts errors that never occur", "Focuses too much on learner cognition"],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: " CA often predicts errors that learners never actually make."
  },
  {
    q: "Errors like ‘goed’ or ‘comed’ are problematic for CA because they result from:",
    choices: ["L1 interference", "Overgeneralization of L2 rules"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " These are developmental errors—common even in L1 children—not L1 transfer."
  },
  {
    q: "Error Analysis (EA) differs from CA because EA:",
    choices: ["Predicts errors before they happen", "Analyzes actual errors learners produce"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " EA starts with real learner data, not theoretical predictions."
  },
  {
    q: "In EA, a ‘mistake’ is:",
    choices: ["A systematic error showing incomplete competence", "A random slip that can be self-corrected"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " Mistakes are performance slips; errors reflect current competence."
  },
  {
    q: "An Arab learner saying ‘book Ahmad’ instead of ‘Ahmad’s book’ is an example of:",
    choices: ["Intralingual error", "Interlingual (transfer) error"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " This reflects Arabic possessive structure interfering with English."
  },
  {
    q: "Saying ‘comed’ for ‘came’ is classified in EA as:",
    choices: ["Interlingual error", "Intralingual (overgeneralization) error"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " It’s overapplying the regular past tense rule—no L1 involvement."
  },
  {
    q: "Which EA step involves determining if an error comes from L1 or overgeneralization?",
    choices: ["Error identification", "Error source determination"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " Step 6 in Sridhar’s model identifies error sources."
  },
  {
    q: "A limitation of EA is that it:",
    choices: ["Only studies what learners CAN do", "Focuses on deficits without showing learning progression"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " EA highlights errors but doesn’t track how competence develops."
  },
  {
    q: "Learners might avoid certain structures in EA because:",
    choices: ["They’ve mastered them", "They fear making errors (avoidance strategy)"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " This ‘avoidance’ skews EA data—errors aren’t always visible."
  },
  {
    q: "Interlanguage (IL) views learner language as:",
    choices: ["Random errors", "A systematic, rule-governed transitional system"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " IL is coherent, evolving, and internally consistent—not chaotic."
  },
  {
    q: "Who coined the term ‘Interlanguage’?",
    choices: ["Larry Selinker", "Robert Lado"],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: " Selinker (1969) introduced the term now central to SLA."

    explanation: " Fossilized errors persist despite exposure or instruction."
  },
  {
    q: "Which is NOT a process in Selinker’s IL model?",
    choices: ["L1 transfer", "Universal Grammar activation"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " Selinker’s five processes include L1 transfer, training transfer, learning strategies, communication strategies, and overgeneralization—not UG."
  },
  {
    q: "Overgeneralization (e.g., ‘goed’) is part of which IL process?",
    choices: ["L1 transfer", "Overgeneralization of L2 rules"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " It’s a core cognitive process in IL development."
  },
  {
    q: "IL is ‘permeable’ because:",
    choices: ["Its rules are fixed from the start", "Its rules are unstable and constantly revised"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " Permeability means IL evolves as learners integrate new input."
  },
  {
    q: "Which factor can cause fossilization?",
    choices: ["Rich, immersive input", "Advanced age or low motivation"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " Selinker linked fossilization to psychological and social factors."
  },
  {
    q: "IL methodology compares:",
    choices: ["Only L1 and L2", "L1 output, IL output, and native L2 output"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " Triangulating these three reveals the learner’s transitional system."
  },
  {
    q: "A key criticism of IL theory is:",
    choices: ["It ignores L1 influence", "It lacks agreed methods to track IL change over time"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " Longitudinal data is hard to collect, making developmental claims difficult to verify."
  },
  {
    q: "Which approach is most learner-centered?",
    choices: ["Contrastive Analysis", "Interlanguage theory"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " IL sees learners as active hypothesis-testers, not passive habit-formers."
  },
  {
    q: "Forensic linguistics in AL might involve:",
    choices: ["Designing grammar drills", "Analyzing threatening messages for authorship"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " It applies linguistic analysis to legal and investigative contexts."

  {
    q: "In multilingual Algeria, AL helps decide:",
    choices: ["Which font to use in textbooks", "Which languages should be used in education and courts"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " AL informs language policy with research on identity, access, and equity."
  },
  {
    q: "CDA examines how language:",
    choices: ["Follows syntactic trees", "Reproduces power and inequality"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " CDA reveals ideology in media, politics, and advertising."
  },
  {
    q: "The shift from CA to EA reflected a move from:",
    choices: ["Learner-focused to teacher-focused", "Teacher-focused to learner-focused"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " EA put the learner’s output—not just L1-L2 comparison—at the center."
  },
  {
    q: "Which error type is ‘turn off the TV’ vs. ‘close the TV’?",
    choices: ["Syntactic overgeneralization", "Semantic transfer"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " ‘Close’ reflects L1 (Arabic) verb usage—semantic interference."
  },
  {
    q: "‘He is comes’ is an example of:",
    choices: ["Morphological overgeneralization", "Syntactic intralingual error"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " It’s a faulty combination of progressive and simple present—within L2 system."
  },
  {
    q: "According to CA, teaching content should equal:",
    choices: ["All L2 grammar", "The sum of L1-L2 differences"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " Lee (1968) argued teaching should focus only on contrasts."
  },
  {
    q: "Which is a ‘new category’ for Arabic speakers learning English?",
    choices: ["Plural nouns", "Indefinite articles ('a', 'an')"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " Arabic lacks indefinite articles—making this a ‘new category’ in Stockwell’s hierarchy."
  },
  {
    q: "AL is interdisciplinary because it draws on:",
    choices: ["Only linguistics", "Psychology, sociology, law, education, and more"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " As AAAL states, AL integrates humanities, social, and natural sciences."
  },
  {
    q: "Which statement reflects Widdowson’s view of AL?",
    choices: ["AL directly applies theory", "AL mediates and adapts theory to human realities"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " Widdowson emphasized mediation—not mechanical application."
  },
  {
    q: "In EA, ‘errors of competence’ are:",
    choices: ["Random slips", "Systematic deviations reflecting current L2 knowledge"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " These show the learner’s developing but incomplete system."
  },
  {
    q: "Why is ‘complete correspondence’ the easiest in CA?",
    choices: ["L1 and L2 share similar forms", "L1 has more complex rules"],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: " When structures match (e.g., past tense), learning is facilitated."
  },
  {
    q: "Which is a communication strategy in IL?",
    choices: ["Using L1 word order", "Using gestures or paraphrasing to convey meaning"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: " Communication strategies help learners express ideas despite gaps in knowledge."
